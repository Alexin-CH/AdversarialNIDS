        "- **Dataset Characteristics:** CIC-IDS2017 dataset contains network traffic data for the development and evaluation of intrusion detection systems. The dataset is designed to be representative of modern network traffic and includes more than 2.8 million network packets captured over a period of seven days in a real network environment. The dataset includes normal traffic and seven different attack scenarios: Brute Force, Heartbleed, Botnet, DoS, DDoS, Web Attack and Infiltration. The dataset is highly imbalanced. The majority of records belongs to the 'Benign' class and relatively few records belongs to the other classes. The dataset consists of 2830743 rows and 79 columns. In these columns, 78 of them are features that are numerical and the 'label' column is categorical.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** This dataset have many duplicate values (308381), which creates bias that is not good for the machine learning model. The number of missing values and infinite values on two columns 'Flow Bytes/s' and 'Flow Packets/s' are very few comparing to the size of the dataset which is only 0.06% (1564). However, the values were handled using appropriate methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Data Preprocessing:** We dropped the duplicates, replaced any infinite values (positive or negative) with NaN (not a number) and filled the missing values with median values. Since we have a very large dataset, the initial memory usage is quite high leading to session crashes. We later worked our way through this by down casting data types based on the min and max values available. We try to reduce the memory usages that is helpful for our model.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Data Analysis:** We grouped similar attacks together to analyze the dataset and identify patterns in the different types of attacks. We took a sample from the population (20%). Later we did some data analysis which consist of plotting various kinds of charts, correlation matrices etc. to see the relationships between features, types of attacks present in the dataset etc. In our analysis, we noticed there are a good number of features that are strongly, even directly correlated with other features (both positive and negative). This is an issue it introduces multi-collinearity which can highly impact the machine learning models that we will develop later.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Also, as the dataset is quite huge and has more than 70 features, it would be extremely difficult to train models using limited resources. In order to overcome this issue, we used PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduece dimensions. We played with the number of components to see how much information we can preserve. We monitored the '*explained_variance_ratio_*' to make sure we retain most informations. However, it was a bit challenging to reduce dimensions while preserving the information to train the models. We performed StandardScaler before performing Incremental PCA.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **ML Models:** It is worth mentioning the fact that the following dataset is highly imbalanced. So, we created a balanced dataset out of this with our domain knowledge to train various ML models. Since our dataset is quite large and has a reasonable amount of samples to train and test different ML models using various classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine for Binary Classification and Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbours for Multi-class Classification).\n",
        "\n",
        "  For binary classifications, we trained the models to distinguish between normal traffic and anomalous traffic. This means it will only predict whether an intrusion is taking place or not. Alternatively, using the multi-class classification algorithms, we further extended our prediction capabilities to identify which type of attack or intrusion is taking place. We tried both binary classifications and multi-class classifications to see how the data holds up. Later we cross-validated, evaluated and compared those models to see which one works better or worse.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Performance Evaluation:** After training multiple machine learning models, we proceeded to evaluate their respective performances. Our evaluation process involved comparing the accuracy, recall, f1-score and confusion matrix of each model. Through analysis of the results, we were able to see which model performed the best and which performed worse."

The box plot of the Flow Bytes/s and Flow Packets/s shows that the variables have extreme values or outliers. So, our strategy is to fill in missing values with median value. Because, filling the missing values with the median does not introduce any new categories or disrupt the distribution of the data."

As we already know that the following dataset is highly imbalanced, we took the help of **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to upsample the minority classes while creating a balanced dataset for multi-class classification.

        "Based on our various tests, we found out that logistic Regression can handle large size data and can be trained in a very short amount of time. However, the drawback is less accurate models. On the other hand, SVM is quite computationally expensive and takes a hefty amount of time to train. but the good thing is the accuracy score is much higher than the logistic regression models. We tuned a few parameters here and there to improve the models' accuracy. We also did cross-validation to make sure that our model was not overfitted and was trained just right.\n",
        "\n",
        "One other thing to mention is that the accuracy of the models is dependent on the standardization of the dataset. We trained our model with and without the use of a standard scaler. During our testing different models, we found out that the accuracy and other performance measure scores went significantly high after standardizing the dataset. So, we chose to standardize data before applying PCA.\n",

        "\n",
        "The time taken to train the multi-class classification models is relatively lower than the binary classification models. This could be due to the fact that the train data size is smaller than the binary classification train data.\n",
        "\n",
        "As shown above in the analysis section, the dataset is highly imbalanced. In order to keep the data balanced over all classes, we first took most number of samples from the minority classes and sufficient number of sample from the majority clasees. Later we used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to create an overall balanced dataset for training the multi-class classification models.\n",
        "\n",
        "By comparing the performance metrics of the models, we see that Random Forest is the best performing model followed by KNN and Decision Tree. From the confusion matrix and the classification report, the dominance of Random Forest in terms of precision, recall, and f1-score is evident. The reason Decision Tree falling behind is that it is not always expressive enough to capture complex relationships between the input features and the target variable. Decision Tree may struggle with problems where the target variable depends on a combination of input features rather than just one or two features. KNN and Random Forest can handle more complex relationships between the input features and the target variable by using more flexible models. Also, we used relatively fewer parameters to tune the Decision Tree models. Just like the binary classification algorithms, we also cross-validated the multi-class classification models to make sure they were not overfitted.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Future Work:** Keeping this in mind, we have to choose our model accordingly if we want to stick with one. However, In this case, we can also combine the KNN and Random Forest classifiers using an ensemble method. This can improve the accuracy of our intrusion detection system by leveraging the strengths of both models and reducing the risk of overfitting. The ensemble method would allow the models to work together to produce a more robust prediction, which could be more effective at identifying different types of network attack.\n"
